## Executive Summary

KolamCraft is an innovative digital platform designed to preserve, revive, and evolve the ancient tradition of Kolam drawing—India’s iconic geometric floor art practiced for millennia. This document outlines the platform's vision, cultural significance, technical architecture, core features, educational impact, and societal benefits. KolamCraft blends technology with tradition to create a vibrant, interactive community supporting creativity, cultural continuity, and STEM learning.

## Introduction

Kolams (also known as Rangoli, Muggu, or Mandana) are intricate geometric patterns created daily at the thresholds of homes and temples. Traditionally made with rice flour or chalk powder, Kolams symbolize prosperity, mindfulness, and welcome. Passed down through generations, they form a living bridge between art, spirituality, and mathematics.

In modern urban life, this rich tradition faces challenges due to changing residential patterns, lifestyle changes, and reduced intergenerational knowledge sharing. KolamCraft addresses these challenges by transforming Kolam into a digital, interactive experience accessible on any device, while retaining cultural depth.

---

## Current Situation and Need

Kolam serves multiple social and cultural roles:

- **Cultural Blessings:** Symbols of good fortune and positive energy.
- **Mindfulness Ritual:** A daily creative act fostering calmness and focus.
- **Educational Tools:** Introducing children to concepts of symmetry and pattern recognition.

**Modern challenges include:**

- Urban lifestyle constraints limiting space/time for physical Kolam drawing.
- Younger generations’ inclination toward digital media.
- Weakening knowledge transfer without community or familial guidance.
- Existing digital platforms only provide passive, static Kolam images without interactivity or learning.

Unless revitalized, this tradition risks becoming purely festival decoration, losing its daily vibrancy and deeper meaning.

## Vision and Human-Centered Design

KolamCraft envisions **digitally reviving Kolam as a daily living practice and creative language enriching homes, classrooms, and communities worldwide.**

**Design principles:**

- Natural, warm user interfaces reflecting physical Kolam qualities.
- Guided creative learning blending storytelling with hands-on practice.
- Community interaction fostering shared joy and cultural celebration.
- AI-enabled tools gently guiding, suggesting, and inspiring without overwhelming tradition.

Every feature was user-tested with cultural practitioners to balance authenticity with modern usability.
